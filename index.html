                <p>Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it? You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal! Nay,<p>I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar.
                What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food. You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs?</p>
                <p>These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are. Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts! Yeah, lots of people did.</p>

                <p>Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. You mean while I'm sleeping in it? I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe!</p>
                <p>Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!</p>
