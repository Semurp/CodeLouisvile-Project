#CodeLou_FrontEnd##
This project is just a simple responsive website showcasing some foundational concepts of the Code Louisville Front End Development Course.




##Custom CSS Classes

Below are some of my examples of custom CSS classes and ID's.

.main-header - Houses most of the top portion of the site. It contains titles, the navigation bar etc.
.slideshow - This is the center div with a background attached to it. It shows a picture of louisville.
.footer - Bottom of the site, and shows a copyright symbol and my name.
.main-navi - Contains the lists that make up my navigation bar.
#quoteTitle - This is my javascript function and I classed this to be able to style the quotes that come out of the generator.
#quoteClick - This is the actual button that you click to generate a quote.
.zone-one - Left content area below the slideshow div. Contains text.
.zone-three - Right content area with the same purpose as stated above.
img-bar - This is my image bar above the footer. Contains several images that will resize with the viewport.

##Custom JavaScript Functions

My custom javascript function is a quote generator. I have several quotes listed as variables and I created a function that calls upon a quote at random using the 
random number generator code 
and then returns one of the listed quotes as a response. 
That response is then displayed with my center div on the webpage.
